# Interactive Turkey Map

## --> This project is no longer in development.


TODO:
- Mobile device support will be research
- Performance test

SUGGESTION:
- Search box option (When type city/region name in search box, city/region shows up)
- Responsive option (needs to improve SVG knowledge)

Note: Modalbox content does not work with file system, you need localhost or server.
